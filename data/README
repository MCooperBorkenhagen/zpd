The top 500 data set (or any top_N set)
represents the top N words from kidwords
that are also in the EWFG/TASA set and
in the ELP set, ranked by frequency
(i.e., the nth ranked word is the nth most
frequent word, based on the TASA frequencies).

Frequencies are calculated based on the 
cumulative frequencies for levels 1-4 in
the EWFG/TASA data (which is up to and
including 3rd grade).

See data.Rmd for write details on these
files. Note that kidwords/ is an independent
github repository.
