```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

require(tidyverse)
require(knitr)

tune_2 = read_csv('outputs/tune_top_500_v2.csv')

```

Look at distribution of accuracy for tuned models in `pilot_1`.

```{r}
tune_2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(accuracy_train)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Examine highest performing pilot models:

```{r}
tune_2 %>% 
  filter(accuracy_train == max(tune_2$accuracy_train)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(accuracy_test)) %>% 
  select(hidden_units, learning_rate, batch_size, epochs, accuracy_test, loss_test, mse_test) %>%
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

We will go with the hyperparameters that show the highest train accuracy, and the highest test accuracy, lowest test loss, and lowest test error:

Hidden units: 30
Learning rate: .005
Batch size: 10
Epochs: 100
